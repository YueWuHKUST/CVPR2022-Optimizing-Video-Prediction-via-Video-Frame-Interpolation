Abstract:
_Video prediction is an extrapolation task that predicts future frames given past frames, and video frame interpolation is an interpolation task that estimates intermediate frames between two frames. We have witnessed the tremendous advancement of video frame interpolation, but the general video prediction in the wild is still an open question. Inspired by the photo-realistic results of video frame interpolation, we present a new optimization framework for video prediction via video frame interpolation, in which we solve an extrapolation problem based on an interpolation model. Our video prediction framework is based on optimization with a pretrained differentiable video frame interpolation module without the need for a training dataset, and thus there is no domain gap issue between training and test data. Also, our approach does not need any additional information such as semantic or instance maps, which makes our framework applicable to any video. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes, KITTI, DAVIS, Middlebury, and Vimeo90K datasets show that our video prediction results are robust in general scenarios, and our approach outperforms other video prediction methods that require a large amount of training data or extra semantic information._

## Requirements
- Currently only Linux is supported.
- 64-bit Python 3.6 installation or newer. We recommend using Anaconda3.
- All the experiments are conducted using NVIDIA RTX 3090Ti. And we recommend using 8 GPUS for faster optimization.

As shown in the parallel example in 
```
./scripts/run.py 
```

## Installation
Clone the repository and set up a conda environment with all dependencies as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/YueWuHKUST/CVPR2022-Optimizing-Video-Prediction-via-Video-Frame-Interpolation
cd CVPR2022-Optimizing-Video-Prediction-via-Video-Frame-Interpolation
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate videopred
```

## Results
**We provide our results on various datasets as indicted below.**

**All the results are sorted in** [**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OkZmFUL3AYpWUN2q-QgvwE3TueoALBu9?usp=sharing)

|Dataset|Resolution|
|:----:|:-----------:|
|Cityscapes | 1024x512 |
|Kitti | 832x256 |
|DAVIS | 896x480 |
|Middlebury | 640x480 |
|Vimeo | 448x256 |

## Evaluation datasets
All the evaluation datasets are downloaded from official link and conduct only resize operations without any other special preprocessing.

```
./CVPR2022-Optimizing-Video-Prediction-via-Video-Frame-Interpolation/
|
./datasets/
    │
    └───   Cityscapes
    └───    KTTIT
    ...
```


### Running Optimization
We provide optimization scripts in folder "./scripts/"
For example, 
```
bash ./scrips/cityscapes.sh
```
All the experiments in the paper are conducted using multiprocessing for reducing time. 

We also provide a script as a reference.
```
./scripts/run.py
```


Note that all the scores reported in the paper are using the setting of optimized every frame for 3K iterations. And We also provide a convergence analysis as indicted in Paper Section 4.4, that our method conveges around 1K iterations. 

### Evaluation

Our evaluation follows the setting of [FVS](https://github.com/YueWuHKUST/CVPR2020-FutureVideoSynthesis).
For the evaluation of Cityscapes and Kitti datasets, we use the same test split as FVS, and also adopt the MS-SSIM and LPIPS as evaluation metric.

And the evaluation scripts are put in 
```
./evaluation/
```
By running the evaluation script within our provided result, the score should be identical to scores reported in the paper.
